### Please note that both versions are mockups, as the client did provide enough content, usable images and a sense of what they wanted (hence the remake).

This project was created using React.js/HTML/CSS and was intentionally made for an Engineering Consultant company that needed an informative website. 
You will notice that the same images are used as well as some dummy text because the client did not provide enough details of what they want. It was all created by a few photos that they gave me and me writing/designing the webpages by myself.
