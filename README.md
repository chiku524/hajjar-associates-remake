### Please note that both versions are mockups, as the client did provide enough content, usable images and a sense of what they wanted (hence the remake).

This project was created using React.js/HTML/CSS and was intentionally made for an Engineering Consultant company that needed an informative website. 
You will notice that the same images are used as well as some dummy text because the client did not provide enough details of what they want. It was all created by a few photos that they gave me and me writing/designing the webpages by myself.

## As of now, this project features:
1. Home page that links you to more detailed pages of the company.
2. An about page that summarizes what the company is made up of.
3. A 'What We Do' page that summarizes what the company does.
4. An industry page that is supposed to show what industries the company covers.
5. A certifications page that shows what the company is certified to do.
6. A 'Contact Us' page that allows the user to email the company, directly from the website.
